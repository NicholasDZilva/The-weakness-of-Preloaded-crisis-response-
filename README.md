Repository Overview
This repository contains two complementary documents that together form a comparative governance project examining how states respond to violent crises — and how those responses can either reduce harm or reallocate power without solving the underlying problem.
The project is grounded in three core principles:
Baseline Preservation – Civil and legal rights should not be permanently eroded unless directly necessary to prevent harm.
Human Agency Preservation – Interventions should target behaviours, not beliefs or identity.
High Coherence – Crisis responses should directly address the causal mechanisms revealed by the triggering event.

1. Preloaded crisis policy paper.txt
Title:
When Crisis Meets Pre-Loaded Policy: A Structural Comparison of Australia’s Hate Speech Laws and the Violent Radical Extremism Prevention Act
What this file is:
A 6,000-word analytical paper that examines Australia’s post-crisis hate speech and extremism laws using a formal evaluation framework — the Crisis Response Coherence Index (CRCI).
What the paper does:
Analyses the triggering event (the Bondi Beach attack) as a problem-space failure
Examines the institutional response (hate speech and extremism legislation)
Introduces a comparative alternative (the VREP Act)
Scores both approaches across seven dimensions:
Trigger–Problem Alignment
Harm Reduction Effectiveness
Coherence Integrity
Baseline Preservation
Human Agency Preservation
Power Centralisation
Profit Capture Exposure
Key finding:
The institutional response scores low on coherence and causal alignment, functioning primarily as symbolic mitigation and mandate expansion, while the alternative framework demonstrates a high-coherence, behaviour-focused approach to violence prevention.
This paper is diagnostic — it explains why certain crisis responses fail structurally, regardless of intent.
2. Open source Extremism bill.txt
Title:
Violent Radical Extremism Prevention Act 2026 (Open-Source Draft)
What this file is:
A complete, citizen-designed draft Bill written as a problem-space-aligned alternative to the institutional response analysed in the paper.
What the Bill does:
Targets observable behaviours linked to violent extremism (planning, recruitment, financing, material preparation)
Preserves speech, belief, and lawful association
Embeds judicial oversight, proportionality, and time limits
Prioritises early intervention, mental health support, and deradicalisation
Includes measurable effectiveness metrics rather than proxy indicators (e.g. online speech)
What it avoids:
Criminalising ideology or identity
Expanding speech regulation as a proxy for safety
Open-ended emergency powers
Permanent baseline erosion
This Bill is published as open source to invite critique, iteration, and comparative improvement — not as a claim of final authority.
How the Two Files Relate
The relationship between the two documents is intentional and structural:
The paper identifies and explains a governance failure pattern:
crises triggering the deployment of pre-loaded policy frameworks rather than solutions aligned with the actual causal problem.
The Bill demonstrates a concrete alternative:
what a high-coherence, citizen-designed response looks like when built from the problem space outward.
In short:
The paper diagnoses the problem.
The Bill proves an alternative is possible.
They are designed to be read side-by-side.
Why This Repository Exists
This project exists to show that:
Citizens living in the problem space are capable of producing structurally coherent policy
Crisis governance can be evaluated objectively, not rhetorically
Rights preservation and public safety are not mutually exclusive
Poor crisis responses are often a design failure, not a necessity
The intent is not partisan advocacy, but comparative clarity.
